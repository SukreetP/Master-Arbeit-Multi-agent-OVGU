# Topic: 'Developement of a Multi-Agent reinforcement learning approach to deal with deadlocks in an automated guided vehicle system'

The main objective of this thesis is to provide a generic approach in terms of
Multi-agent reinforcement learning in handling deadlocks in a logistical warehouse
management system by providing a modified deep q-learning approach using DQN
(Deep-Q Networks) as a learning agent for AGVâ€™s taking actions on the environment
involving a capable deadlock scenario with the independent q-learning approach. The
agents are trained and compared based on different modifications on DQN agents as
well as comparison of the trained agents taking action in a modified environment with
varied changes in environmental parameters created in a simulation environment (Siemens Plant Simulation).
